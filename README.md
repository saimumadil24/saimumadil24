### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My Name is Saimum Adil Khan
#### I am a Data Scientist

As a data scientist, I'm passionate about finding patterns and insights in large, complicated data sets. I can transform data into useful insights that help firms grow and function more effectively thanks to my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

Through my full-time work on Kaggle, where I have taken on a variety of difficult data science issues, I have refined my talents. I have a thorough understanding of the most recent methods and tools available thanks to my experience on Kaggle, and I am always learning new things to keep my knowledge current.

Python is my preferred language, and I have a lot of experience using it for deep learning and machine learning applications. Additionally, I have experience utilizing Flask to create web applications that leverage machine learning models.

I appreciate working with people and imparting my skills in order to advance others' data science knowledge. I am always happy to interact with people that share my love for data science, whether it be when working on a challenging project or simply talking about the most recent trends in the industry.


Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Flask
