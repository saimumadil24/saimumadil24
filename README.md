### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
### My Name is Saimum Adil Khan
#### I am a Data Scientist

As a data scientist, I am passionate about finding patterns and insights in large, complicated datasets. With my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, I can transform data into useful insights that help companies grow and operate more efficiently.

I have honed my skills through my full-time work on Kaggle, where I have tackled a variety of challenging data science problems. My experience on Kaggle has given me a deep understanding of the latest techniques and tools available, and I am always learning new things to keep my knowledge up-to-date.

Python is my language of choice and I have extensive experience using it for deep learning and machine learning applications. I also have experience using Flask to build web applications that leverage machine learning models.

I enjoy working with people and sharing my knowledge to help others advance their data science skills. Whether itâ€™s working on a challenging project or simply discussing the latest trends in the industry, I am always happy to connect with others who share my passion for data science.


Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Flask

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Kaggle
